Flipkart App Order Analysis Project: EDA and Feature Engineering
Introduction
In this project, we aim to analyze the order data from the Flipkart app, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to gain insights into user behavior and order patterns. This analysis will help in understanding the factors influencing customer decisions and improving the overall shopping experience.

Objectives
Data Understanding: Familiarize with the dataset to identify key attributes and their relevance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize visualizations and statistical methods to uncover trends, correlations, and anomalies in the order data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that can enhance model performance for future predictive analytics.
Data Collection
The dataset consists of various attributes, including:

Order ID
Customer ID
Product Category
Order Date
Delivery Time
Payment Method
Order Amount
User Ratings
EDA Process
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and duplicates to ensure data integrity.
Descriptive Statistics: Compute mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to summarize the data.
Visualizations:
Order Trends: Line charts to visualize the number of orders over time.
Product Categories: Bar charts to show the distribution of orders across different categories.
Payment Method Analysis: Pie charts to depict the proportion of various payment methods used.
Correlation Analysis: Use heatmaps to identify relationships between numerical features.
Feature Engineering
Order Frequency: Create a feature to measure how often a customer places orders.
Average Order Value: Calculate the average order amount for each customer to identify high-value customers.
Recency: Measure the time since the last order to analyze customer retention.
Delivery Time: Generate a feature to assess the average delivery time for different products or categories.
Conclusion
Through EDA and feature engineering, we aim to derive actionable insights that can enhance marketing strategies and improve customer engagement. This project lays the foundation for further predictive modeling to anticipate customer behavior and optimize the Flipkart app experience.

Next Steps
Implement machine learning models to predict future orders.
Validate the impact of newly engineered features on model performance.
Continue monitoring trends and adapting strategies based on insights gathered.
This project not only provides a comprehensive analysis of Flipkart app orders but also sets the stage for future data-driven decisions in e-commerce strategies.
